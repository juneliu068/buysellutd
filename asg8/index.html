  <h1>Domain Names for My Semester Project</h1>

  <h2>Three domain name ideas</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>UTDStudentMark.com</li>
    <li>BuySellUTD.com</li>
    <li>CometSwap.com</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I reviewed my three domain name ideas with a classmate. We talked about which name is easiest to remember,
    easiest to spell, and easiest to say out loud. My classmate recommended choosing a name that clearly shows
    the website is for students and buying/selling, without being too long. We also typed each domain in all
    lowercase to make sure it does not look confusing or accidentally form different words.

  <p>
    The domain name I like best is BuySellUTD.com because it feels clear and straightforward.
    “UTD” immediately shows it is for Comets, and “Buy” and “Sell” clearly explain what the website is for. The name is short, easy to spell, and easy to remember, which makes it simple to share with other students.
